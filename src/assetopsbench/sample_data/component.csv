equipment,component,explanation
chiller,compressor,"compresses the refrigerant to increase its pressure and temperature, essential for the cooling cycle."
chiller,condenser,"condenses the refrigerant by transferring heat to the cooling medium, typically water or air."
chiller,evaporator,"absorbs heat from the chilled water, causing the refrigerant to evaporate and complete the cooling process."
chiller,control system,"monitors and regulates the chiller's operations, including temperature, pressure, and flow."
chiller,temperature sensor,"measure the temperature of refrigerant, water, and other fluids within the chiller system."
chiller,pressure sensor,detect and monitor the pressure levels of refrigerant and water to ensure safe and efficient operation.
chiller,flow meter,"measure the flow rate of water, refrigerant, or coolant to maintain proper system balance."
chiller,expansion valve,"controls the flow of refrigerant into the evaporator, reducing its pressure and causing it to cool."
chiller,cooling tower,"removes heat from the condenser water by allowing it to evaporate, typically used in water-cooled systems."
chiller,motor,"drives the compressor or other mechanical components, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy."
chiller,refrigerant circuit,"the path through which refrigerant flows, including the compressor, condenser, evaporator, and expansion valve."
chiller,chilled water system,"circulates chilled water to and from the evaporator, distributing cooling to the building or process."
chiller,cooling system,"includes all components involved in the cooling process, such as compressor, condenser, evaporator, and control system."
chiller,chiller,a machine that removes heat from a liquid via a vapor-compression or absorption refrigeration cycle.
